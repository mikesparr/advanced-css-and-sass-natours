# Custom CSS-powered Web Page
This web page was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann for his course Advanced CSS and SASS on Udemy.

## Features
 * No JavaScript (completely CSS and HTML5 using SCSS)
 * BEM naming convention
 * 7-1 Sass architecture
 * Animations galore
 * Custom form
 * Popups
 * Menu navigation
 * Video background
 * Footer navigation

## Usage
Instead of just opening the `html` page in a browser via file reference, use a simple web server to launch it and update as changes are detected.

 * `npm install -g live-server`
 * Terminal 1: `npm run compile:sass` (will watch for changes and recompile)
 * Terminal 2: `live-server` (will launch default browser and refresh on change)

## TODO
The next major commit will include media queries and responsive breakpoints to complete the project
